\par \cf1\ul\b Expected result
\par \pard\qj\cf0\lang1033\ulnone\b0\f1\fs24 The Invoices are properly shipped and EOM application can also respond to other requests.
\par \pard\lang1048\f0\fs16 
\par \cf1\ul\b Actual result
\par \pard\qj\cf0\lang1033\ulnone\b0\f1\fs24 EOM application is not responding to other requests (e.g. View invoice request) or not respond at all (e.g. shutdown command can not be performed - only kill -9 will stop the application). - \cf2\b BUG\cf0\b0

\par \cf1\ul\b Remark
\par \pard\qj\cf0\lang1033\ulnone\b0\f1\fs24 In order for the customer to be able to view invoices we have restarted the EOM application, but this was not enough. Only after truncating jbm_msg and jbm_msg_ref tables and restart again the EOM application the view invoice and other requests were functional.
